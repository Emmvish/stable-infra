**Use Case:** Large-scale data migration pipeline that can survive application restarts, run across multiple server instances, and resume from any checkpoint. Perfect for long-running workflows requiring resilience against infrastructure failures, database migrations, ETL pipelines, and distributed batch processing.

**Recovery Behavior Example:**
```
Initial Run (fails at Validate):
✓ Extract Source Data    → Checkpoint saved
✓ Transform Data         → Checkpoint saved
✗ Validate Data          → FAILURE

Resume Run:
⏭ Extract Source Data    → SKIPPED (already completed)
⏭ Transform Data         → SKIPPED (already completed)
✓ Validate Data          → EXECUTED
✓ Migrate Data           → EXECUTED
✓ Verify Migration       → EXECUTED
```

**State Persistence Configuration:**
```typescript
// Phase-level persistence
statePersistence: {
  persistenceFunction: persistToRedis,
  persistenceParams: { 
    ttl: 3600,              // 1 hour expiration
    enableLocking: true,     // Distributed lock
    namespace: 'migration'   // Key prefix
  },
  loadBeforeHooks: true,     // Load state before phase hooks
  storeAfterHooks: true      // Save state after phase hooks
}

// Global workflow persistence
commonStatePersistence: {
  persistenceFunction: createCheckpoint,
  persistenceParams: { ttl: 7200 },
  loadBeforeHooks: true,
  storeAfterHooks: true
}
```

**When to Use This Pattern:**
- ✅ Workflows that take more than 5 minutes to complete
- ✅ Processing large datasets (millions of records)
- ✅ Running on infrastructure that may restart (Kubernetes, cloud instances)
- ✅ Need visibility into workflow progress across systems
- ✅ Multiple instances need to coordinate work
- ✅ Failures are expensive and resumption is critical

**Production Considerations:**
- Use Redis Cluster for high availability
- Set appropriate TTL based on workflow duration
- Adjust lock timeouts based on phase execution time
- Monitor state object sizes (Redis has limits)
- Implement periodic cleanup of old workflow states
- Add metrics for state persistence operations
- Implement retry logic for Redis connection failures
