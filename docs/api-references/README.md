### [Stable API Gateway](./stable-api-gateway.md)
Batch request processing with configuration cascading, request grouping, and concurrent execution.

**Key Features:**
- Batch HTTP requests and function execution
- Request grouping with group-level configuration
- Configuration cascade (Individual → Group → Global)
- Concurrent and sequential execution modes
- Shared state buffers across requests
- Circuit breaker and caching per group
- Infrastructure metrics aggregation
- Request-level observability hooks

---

### [Stable Workflow](./stable-workflow.md)
Multi-phase workflow orchestration with sequential, concurrent, mixed, non-linear, and branched execution patterns.

**Key Features:**
- 5 execution modes: Sequential, Concurrent, Mixed, Non-Linear, Branched
- Phase decision hooks with actions (CONTINUE, SKIP, JUMP, REPLAY, TERMINATE)
- Branch decision system for conditional branching
- Dynamic phase injection
- Shared buffers for cross-phase state
- Phase replay with max count limits
- Early termination with reason tracking
- State persistence for workflow recovery
- Comprehensive workflow metrics

---

### [Stable Workflow Graph](./stable-workflow-graph.md)
Graph-based workflow orchestration with conditional routing, parallel execution, and merge points.

**Key Features:**
- 5 node types: PHASE, BRANCH, CONDITIONAL, PARALLEL_GROUP, MERGE_POINT
- 4 edge condition types: SUCCESS, FAILURE, CUSTOM, ALWAYS
- Fluent WorkflowGraphBuilder API
- DAG validation and cycle detection
- Conditional routing based on results
- Parallel group execution with synchronization
- Merge point dependencies
- Graph visualization and debugging
- Reusable workflow patterns

---

### [Stable Scheduler](./stable-scheduler.md)
Queue-based scheduler with cron/interval/timestamp scheduling and state recoverability.

**Key Features:**
- Concurrency-limited queue execution
- Cron, interval, and timestamp schedules
- Recoverable state via persistence handlers
- Runner integration for scheduled core jobs

---

### [Stable Buffer](./stable-buffer.md)
Transactional buffer for concurrency-safe shared state across core modules.

**Key Features:**
- Serialized updates via `run()`/`transaction()`
- Snapshot reads with `read()`
- Works with all `commonBuffer`/`sharedBuffer` options
- Lightweight in-memory state
- Optional transaction logging with `logTransaction`
- Per-transaction metadata (`activity`, `hookName`, `hookParams`, `executionContext`)

---

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Utilities

### [Infrastructure Utilities](./infra-utilities.md)
Production-ready infrastructure components for building resilient systems.

**Utilities:**
- **Cache Manager**: HTTP response caching with LRU eviction and TTL
- **Circuit Breaker**: Three-state fail-fast protection (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN)
- **Rate Limiter**: Token bucket sliding-window rate limiting
- **Concurrency Limiter**: Semaphore-based concurrency control
- **Function Cache Manager**: Memoization for expensive computations
- **Metrics Aggregator**: Comprehensive metrics extraction and aggregation
- **Stable Buffer Replay**: Transaction log replay utility for deterministic state reconstruction

---

## 🧰 Runner Utilities

### [Stable Runner](./stable-runner.md)
Config-driven runner for executing Stable Request jobs via JSON or ESM config files.

**Key Features:**
- Config-based execution for all core APIs
- File change detection and auto re-run
- Append-only JSON output for auditability
- Docker-friendly execution model

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install @emmvish/stable-infra
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { stableRequest, stableFunction, stableWorkflow } from '@emmvish/stable-infra';

// Single resilient request
const result = await stableRequest({
  reqData: {
    hostname: 'api.example.com',
    path: '/data'
  },
  attempts: 3,
  resReq: true
});

// Function with resilience
const fnResult = await stableFunction({
  fn: expensiveOperation,
  args: [arg1, arg2],
  attempts: 3,
  returnResult: true
});

// Multi-phase workflow
const workflowResult = await stableWorkflow(phases, {
  workflowId: 'my-workflow',
  concurrentExecution: true
});
```
